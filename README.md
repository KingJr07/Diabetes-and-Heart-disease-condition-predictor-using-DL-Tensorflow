**Diabetes and Heart Disease Condition Predictor using Deep Learning with TensorFlow**

This project leverages Deep Learning techniques with TensorFlow to predict the presence of Diabetes and Heart Disease conditions based on patient data.

**Features:**

* Preprocess and analyze patient data sets for Diabetes and Heart Disease.
* Train and evaluate Deep Learning models for both conditions using TensorFlow.
* Predict the probability of a patient having Diabetes or Heart Disease based on provided data.
* Visualize the decision boundaries and relationships between features and predictions.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow library
* NumPy library
* Pandas library
* Matplotlib library (optional)

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/bard/disease_prediction.git
```
2. Install the required libraries:
```
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas
pip install matplotlib (optional)
```

**Data:**

1. Acquire datasets containing patient data with labeled diagnoses for Diabetes and Heart Disease. These can be publicly available datasets or collected from medical institutions.
2. Place the datasets in the designated directories within the project folder.

**Usage:**

1. Run the specific script for the desired prediction task:
    - `python diabetes_prediction.py` for Diabetes prediction.
    - `python heart_disease_prediction.py` for Heart Disease prediction.
2. The script will automatically load the data, perform preprocessing, train the Deep Learning model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.
3. You can modify the scripts to experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques.

**Output:**

* The script will print the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) of the trained model.
* It will also generate visualizations depicting the decision boundaries and feature importance for prediction.

**Further improvements:**

* Explore different Deep Learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for potentially improved performance.
* Implement feature engineering techniques to extract additional meaningful features from the data.
* Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal model accuracy andgeneralizability.
* Develop a user interface for interactive disease prediction based on patient data input.
